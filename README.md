## Features

- **Site Management**
- **Automatic Site Information Collection (playwright, jina, openai)**
- **User Management (clerk)**
- **Internationalization**
- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**
- **SEO Optimization**
- **Multiple Image Storage Solutions (local minio, AWS S3, Tencent Cloud COS)**

## Deployment

This project consists of the main navigation site (`packages/aigotools`) and the inclusion service (`packages/crawler`). It can be deployed via hosting services like Zeabur or directly on a local machine using `docker-compose`.

### Prerequisites

- Create an application at https://clerk.com/ and add a user to log in as the admin for the management backend.
- Obtain `OpenAI apiKey` and `jina apiKey`, which are used for site inclusion.
- Set up MongoDB and Redis databases.

### Local Deployment

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/someu/aigotools.git
   cd aigotools
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:
   Copy the `.env` files in `packages/aigotools` and `packages/crawler` to `.env.prod`.

   ```bash
   cp packages/aigotools/.env packages/aigotools/.env.prod
   cp packages/crawler/.env packages/crawler/.env.prod
   ```

   Modify the configuration files accordingly.

3. Start the project:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

**Note: If using minio for image storage, you can initially leave the minio authentication configuration empty when starting the project. After running the project, access the minio management backend to create a Bucket, ACCESS_KEY, and SECRET_KEY, enable public read permissions for the Bucket, update the configuration file, and restart the project.**
