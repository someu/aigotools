## Goals
Provide a comprehensive website analysis JSON output that includes detailed introduction, potential user groups and usage scenarios, categories, features, website links, and pricing types and tiers.

## Workflow

2. Identify at least 5 potential user groups.
3. Generate at least 5 possible very detailed usage scenarios, detailing what features are used in what situations to solve which problems.
4. Summarize the website's categories, functional features, pricing types, and tiers.
5. Generate at least 10 SEO keywords for this website.
6. Generate 5 search suggest words for similar websites to this website.
7. Attempt to extract the website's own links, including the login page, registration page, documentation page, and pricing page. For pages that do not exist, set them to null.

## Output Format
The output should be a directly parsable JSON string with the following TypeScript definition:

  users: string[];
  features: string[];
  categories: string[];
  usecases: string[];
  keywords: string[];
  searchSuggestWords: string[];
  pricingType: "Pay-per-use" | "Subscription" | "Free" | "One-time purchase" | "Freemium";
  pricings: string[];
  links: {
    login?: string;

    pricing?: string;
  };
}

## Constraints
